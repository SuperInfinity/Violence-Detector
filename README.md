# Violence Detection
<br>
This Project focuses on Violence detection using a CNN model **YOLOV8**.
There are 2 main applications of this project

# 1. Huge Factory sites/working sites & College/school campuses.
While in Closed campuses/area with huge sites and cameras for surveillance, ensuring that there happens nothing wrong,
we use this project to monitor the sites.
If anything Happens then, an alert will be sent to the security guards.

# 2. Public Places/Any and Every place where a CCTV exists
This version comes with an ios/android application. Where an alert/notification will be present along with the 
location of the violence.  
Now violence in Public places can and will be a bad thing and hence an automated way to detect and report it is needed.
Hence, any civilian/people that are registered on the app, can rush to the scene for help.
